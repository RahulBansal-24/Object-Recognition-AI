# 🧠 Object Recognition AI using YOLOv8

An advanced **Object Recognition AI** built using the **YOLOv8 model** that detects and labels real-world objects in **images, videos, and live camera feeds**.  
Includes a clean and interactive **Streamlit UI** for easy use.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🖼️ **Image Detection:** Upload an image and view annotated results instantly  
- 🎥 **Video Detection:** Upload a video and get an annotated output video  
- 📸 **Live Camera Detection:** Capture using webcam directly (in Colab)  
- 🧠 **YOLOv8 Integration:** High-performance detection using Ultralytics YOLOv8  
- 🪄 **Custom Streamlit UI:** Polished interface with background and result display  
- 🎓 **Training Ready:** Includes COCO dataset sample (coco128.zip) and weight support
